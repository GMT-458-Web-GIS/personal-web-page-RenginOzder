  <section id="intro">
    <h1>Hi, I‚Äôm Rengin √ñzder.</h1>
    <p>
      I‚Äôm deeply fascinated by the natural world ‚Äî by what happens both above and below the surface of the Earth.
      Since childhood, I‚Äôve been curious about how landscapes evolve and how the planet tells its story through rocks,
      water, and space. That passion led me to pursue my lifelong dream: studying Geological Engineering at
      <strong>Middle East Technical University (METU)</strong>.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="journey">
    <h2>How I got here</h2>
    <p>
      I graduated from METU in 2016, and my curiosity for research led me to continue with a master‚Äôs degree in the same department.
      My thesis, <em>‚ÄúResponses of Planktonic Foraminifera to Environmental Conditions Across the Cretaceous/Paleogene Boundary in the G√∂yn√ºk Basin‚Äù</em>,
      allowed me to explore the relationship between ancient microfossils and changing environments. I completed my studies with a 4.0 GPA
      ‚Äî an experience that shaped not only my scientific mindset but also my patience and love for details.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="now">
    <h2>Where I am now</h2>
    <p>
      Today, I‚Äôm studying <strong>Geomatics Engineering at Hacettepe University</strong>, focusing on the intersection of
      <strong>hydrogeology</strong> and <strong>geodesy</strong>. My current interest is in combining GNSS techniques with
      hydrological observations to address one of the most urgent global challenges: water scarcity.
      In a way, I‚Äôm connecting the ground and the sky ‚Äî merging traditional Earth science with modern satellite technology.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="drives">
    <h2>What drives me</h2>
    <p>
      People often ask whether it‚Äôs scientific curiosity, environmental sustainability, or my connection with nature that keeps me moving.
      Honestly ‚Äî it‚Äôs all of them. For me, science is a language that allows us to listen to Earth‚Äôs quiet rhythms.
      Every dataset, every field observation, every image from orbit feels like a small message from the planet ‚Äî and I want to understand it.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="beyond">
    <h2>Beyond the work</h2>
    <p>
      Beyond research, I love discovering and creating. I enjoy experimenting with <strong>coffee aromas</strong>,
      following <strong>film soundtracks</strong>, <strong>reading</strong>, and <strong>cooking</strong>.
      During my METU years, I was part of the <strong>Gastronomy Society</strong> and <strong>Ankara Volunteers (AGT)</strong>,
      where I found joy in cultural and culinary exploration.  
      I‚Äôm also a proud member of <strong>Ankara K√ºlt√ºr Gezginleri (Anadolu Kartallarƒ±)</strong> ‚Äî a group dedicated to uncovering
      hidden corners of Turkey and the world, always seeking the stories that landscapes have to tell.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="future">
    <h2>Looking ahead</h2>
    <p>
      I hope to continue bridging geology, geomatics, and hydrology ‚Äî connecting data, technology, and curiosity to help build
      a more sustainable understanding of our planet. Whether I‚Äôm analyzing satellite signals or walking through a river valley,
      my goal remains the same: to listen, to learn, and to care for Earth‚Äôs systems.
