Rengin Özder – Personal Web Page (GMT 458 Web GIS Assignment 1)
Overview

This is my personal web page created for GMT 458 – Web GIS Assignment 1. The aim of this assignment was to familiarize myself with HTML, CSS, and OpenLayers (OL) by creating a personal website hosted on GitHub.

The website includes the following pages:

Home

About

Experiences

Portfolio

Blog

Contact

The Home page features a hero section with my introduction and CV download. Other pages showcase my background, education, experiences, projects, blog posts, and contact information. The website also includes an interactive OpenLayers map of Turkey, where clicking on a city redirects to its official cultural portal page.

My GitHub Page: https://renginozder.github.io/renginozderwebsite/

Features

HTML: Multi-page structure as listed above.

CSS: Animations, responsive design, tabular information with images, hover effects.

OpenLayers: Clickable map of 81 Turkish cities linking to the official cultural portal.

Git: Regular use of version control with at least 3 commits on different days.
